## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Bootstrap-v4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

- Comparatively easier site for me to build, somehow need to speed up my workflow!
- The "no-gutters" class when added along with <strong>.row</strong> class, removes the negative margins of the <strong>.row</strong> class.

```html
<h1>Code snippet</h1>
  <div class="row no-gutters"></div>
```

### Continued development

- Require a better understanding of .container-fluid Vs .container Bootstrap classes.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56655968) - This helped me handle the problem of container overflow.
